# Alberto C. R&iacute;os, Software guy

Software Engineer interested in building products people love in agile environments with a focus on high-quality tests.

I'm part of the Spring Engineering team at VMware after the Pivotal acquisition.
We are a fully remote team building products and frameworks to help people adopt microservices architecture and improve the experience of Java and Spring in Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes by providing a secured product, highly available, and adding platform-specific features.
We practice eXtreme Programming, Test Driven Development, Continuous integration, and delivery, follow some Site Reliability Engineering disciplines, and contribute and maintain several Open Source projects.

Before I was working as an eXtreme Programming consultant on a variety of projects and products, including banking and booking systems, IoT platforms, and I was part of the Cloud Foundry Open Source team, one of the largest distributed teams that practised eXtreme Programming.

Apart from the consulting experience, I have been the technical co-founder of a couple of companies:
* Duel.fm where we tried to gamify the way music is discovered. We were awarded by the LaunchHouse accelerator program in Ohio.
* ProHealth where we tried to help to secure and connect medical records. We are awarded by the Bolt accelerator program in M&aacute;laga, Spain, finalist of the Pasion>ie by the Instituto de Empresa, finalists of the Fundetec award, finalist of the AJE award by the Sevilla entrepreneurship association and we were chosen by the 100 paths to success by the Cajasol Institute.

Recently, I have been speaking at different major software conferences, such as the largest software conference in Europe, the largest Java conference in America, and online conferences with thousands of attendees.
